That's great customer service :) RT @mike_nunes: A9) Of course! Then refer them to someone who can. #CustServ

A1:We prioritize suggested improvement on volume, impact, urgency. That is why ticket creation is important for tracking. #bigdata #custserv
@cooshacalendar Why not? If they are successful, something’s going right for them. Why not try to learn something from them? #custserv
